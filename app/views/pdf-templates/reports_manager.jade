                li.font-size-16.p-b-5.blue-color For skills, how you compare is populated by comparing your average score for each each skill (the average across you, your team, your manager, and your multi-raters) to the average score for that particular skill in your function. Not everyone has to be the best in every skill; however, this should help you to see where you stand in comparison to your peers and with your manager you can determine if growth is a worthy pursuit.

            span.blue-color Growth Midset: Stanford psychology professor, Carol Dweck’s research found that people who have a growth mindset believe that their most basic abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work—intelligence and talent are just the starting point. This view creates a desire for learning and a resilience that is essential for great accomplishment. A growth mindset is the opposite of a fixed mindset, where people believe their basic qualities, like their intelligence or talent, are simply fixed traits. They spend their time documenting their intelligence or talent instead of developing them.
